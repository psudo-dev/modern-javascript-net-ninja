## About <a name = "about"></a>

A lot of times I make changes to the course projects and exercises, I try some new things, add something here and there or even extrapolate to something different.

I know that there are several projects alike from Internet courses and tutorials out there so I will only document the tests I've done and the things I've changed.

## Live Demo <a name = "live-demo"></a>

[Ninja Quiz](https://modern-javascript-net-ninja.netlify.app/quiz/)

## Built Using <a name = "built-using"></a>

- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Javascript

## Tests and Changes<a name = "tests"></a>

- I've tested ways to add a question using template string and DOM manipulation.

## Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

- I think that maybe storing the question data in an Object is better than copying and pasting the HTML code several times.
- So maybe I will create a class and a question constructor
- It can end up becoming a quiz contructor page so people can make quiz
